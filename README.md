# Note Taker By Alex Waldmann

This project was pretty simple, in my version I wrote an express router to route to the different endpoints, set up some routes, set up some base logic for posting and requesting the note data inside of db.json, the most complex thing being the fact it's working with a file so to access the db like an object the file must be read to a string then parsed. Finally once the posting and requesting were set up, I realized that a majority of the prioject was done, I wanted to add the delete functionality though and with a little bit of struggling and the knowledge that the JS had the ability to handle an id on the note already (with slight modification) and to pull up and delete a specific note if the notes were tagged with an id. So to generate the id in the post request I made a check which checks if the length of the parsed object from the read db.json file's length is greater than 0, if so the id is generated by reading the last id in the contents (fileContents[fileContents.length - 1].id) and adding 1 to it. This results in ids being generated that do not repeat and will go back to zero if no more items are in the DB.
